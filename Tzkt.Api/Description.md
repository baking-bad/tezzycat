TzKT Explorer provides a free API for accessing detailed Tezos blockchain data and to help developers build more services and applications on top of Tezos.
TzKT API is an open-source project, so you can clone and build it and use as a self-hosted service to avoid any risks of using third-party services.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or if need any specific features or endpoints or query parameters, etc.
Any feedback really helps us make TzKT better.
And don't forget to star TzKT [on GitHub](https://github.com/baking-bad/tzkt) :)

### Terms of Use

TzKT API is free for everyone and for both commercial and non-commercial usage.

If your application or service uses the TzKT API in any forms: directly on frontend or indirectly on backend, you should mention that fact on your website or application
by placing the label **"Powered by TzKT API"** with a direct link to [tzkt.io](https://tzkt.io).

This allows to test latest features and pre-update client applications in case of breaking changes
so API may be used without the adverse consequences of operating in a production environment.

Staging API: `https://staging.api.tzkt.io/` ([view docs](https://staging.api.tzkt.io))

### Rate Limits

There will be no strict rate limits as long as our servers can handle the load without additional infrastructure costs.
However, any apparent abuse will be prevented by setting targeted rate limits.
